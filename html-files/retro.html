        { The Good } <br>
        I am thankful for website templates and the people who make them. I also have a new respect for error messages and front-end coding. I have become much more comfortable with trying something just to see what happens, and I am more often able to accurately pinpoint the selector I need to target to make changes. I also read an interesting article about avoiding lists for accessibility reasons, so I ended up removing mine from my nav.

        Building a wireframe from scratch was tricky enough, but giving the site subtle tweaks ranged from easy as pie to nightmare mode. You want something to underline and get bigger when it hovers? Sure, no problem. You want your name to slide up between the items on your nav bar and disappear? That's cute. I hope you don't have plans for the next three hours. You're about to learn that z-index doesn't work without positioning in place...but not for another 170 minutes. The last 10 minutes was for staring into space because by then my brain had 404'd.

        My images look like lumpy space princess and I have no idea why. I have tried five things from the internet. I am still no closer to solving this mystery.

        { The Good } <br>
        This project made me realize how much I enjoy pair programming! My partner and I worked well together and in the end it improved our code - we had less bugs, used DRY and Single Responsibility in our methods, and our unit tests were more robust. We also learned to use Simplecov and pushed changes to github regularly and with detailed commit messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        { The Bad } <br>
        The path to hell is paved with good intentions, and so was my suggestion to have an "edits" branch on my pair's github (where the project lives) so that we didn't make all of our changes directly on the master branch. This would have worked out if either of us was used to github, but since this was not the case we had a heck of a time getting everything synced to it and the master as well. Ultimately, we left everything on the "edits" branch.
      </p>
      <p>
        { The Ugly } <br>
        We tried to use instance variables everywhere in lieu of calling methods and passing in local variables as parameters. An instructor had to mercy-kill much of our project on the second day, but we still finished on time and our code was much better for it in the end.
